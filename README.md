# Fake-News-Detection-Covid-19-Dataset-Applied-AI-Course-Project-

This is a project we did it for our Applied AI course. We did this project on October of 2021. Here we detected fake news on COVID -19 deploying different machine learning data classifiers using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes.We tried to implement data classifiers using Jupyter Notebook through Python. We extracted various indexed COVID -19 news data from Kaggle, compared the accuracies of all different classifiers and found SVM has the most accuracy of 86% in detecting fake news.
