# Fake-News-Detection-Covid-19-Dataset-Applied-AI-Course-Project-

This is a project we did it for our Applied AI course. Here we-

• Detected fake news on COVID -19 deploying different machine learning data classifiers using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes.
• Implemented data classifiers using Jupyter Notebook through Python.
• Extracted various indexed COVID -19 news data from Kaggle, compared the accuracies of all different classifiers and found SVM has the most accuracy of 86% in detecting fake news.
